# Scheduling Algorithms

Welcome to the **Scheduling Algorithms** repository! This project is a comprehensive implementation and analysis of various scheduling algorithms used in operating systems and computer science. It aims to demonstrate how different algorithms work, their use cases, and their performance under different scenarios.

---

## Features
- **Implementation of Core Scheduling Algorithms:**
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF)
  - Round Robin (RR)
  - Priority Scheduling (Preemptive and Non-Preemptive)
  - Multilevel Queue Scheduling
  - Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling

- **Interactive Interface:**
  - Input job details (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.).
  - Visualize Gantt charts for better understanding of execution order.

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Average waiting time
  - Turnaround time
  - Response time

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanmayaPatra369/Scheduling-Algorithims.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Scheduling-Algorithims
   ```
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., Python, matplotlib, etc.). Install them using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Run the main script to explore the scheduling algorithms:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Provide input details for processes as prompted.
3. Select the scheduling algorithm you want to analyze.
4. View the results and visualizations, including performance metrics and Gantt charts.
